# Rails Connector / Legacy Features

We have been doing some spring cleaning and removed a number of infrequently 
used addons from the [Rails Connector](https://github.com/infopark/rails_connector) gem:

* `Comments`
* `CrmFromController`
* `LinkHelper`
* `Liquid Templates`
* `MenuHelper`
* `MicronavHelper`
* `Ratings`
* `RssController`
* `SearchController`
* `SeoHelper`
* `SeoSitemapController`
* `Timemachine`
* `TrackingHelper`
* `UserController`

The addons are still available as source code: 
The source code is archived at: https://github.com/infopark/rails_connector_legacy_features

If an application of your depends on these addons and you wish to continue using it, 
simply copy the addon's source from the 
[archive](https://github.com/kostia/rails_connector_legacy_features/archive/master.zip) 
and copy it into your application.
