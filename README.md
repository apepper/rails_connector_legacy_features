# ![Infopark](https://raw.github.com/infopark/rails_connector_legacy_features/master/infopark.jpg) Rails Connector / Legacy Features

We have been doing some cleaning and removed a number of infrequently
used addons from the [Rails Connector](https://github.com/infopark/rails_connector) gem:

* `Comments`
* `CrmFromController`
* `LinkHelper`
* `Liquid Templates`
* `MenuHelper`
* `MicronavHelper`
* `Ratings`
* `RssController`
* `SearchController`
* `SeoHelper`
* `SeoSitemapController`
* `Timemachine`
* `TrackingHelper`
* `UserController`

The addons are still available as source code at: https://github.com/infopark/rails_connector_legacy_features

If an application of you depends on these addons and you wish to continue using it,
simply copy the addon's source from the
[archive](https://github.com/kostia/rails_connector_legacy_features/archive/master.zip)
to your application.
