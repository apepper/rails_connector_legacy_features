== Seo Sitemap

The default implementation of the SEO sitemap will reference all the files from your CMS in the generated <tt>sitemap.xml</tt>. For a large number of files, this can slow down your server. Please refer to {RailsConnector::SEO::ClassMethods#find_all_for_sitemap} for advice on optimization.
